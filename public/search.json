The requirements of the framework are derived from the synthesis of findings from the literature and empirical study.

In an empirical study, requirements of m-government service design have been elicited in developing countries. The study focused on requirements regarding the design and the approaches used to design m-government services. This paper presents part of the empirical results. Raw data were collected through questionnaires and interviews. To analyze collected data, we used MAXQDA software. Results presented in this paper include significant requirements of m-government services and design characteristics and approaches for addressing them. The paper demonstrates a lack of understanding and unclear approaches for addressing requirements of m-government services, which is, however, imperative to ensure successful design and implementation of m-government. We conclude with suggestions for addressing the requirements at the government level.","tags":[],"title":"Addressing Requirements of M-Government Services: Empirical Study from Designers' Perspectives","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T.

The lessons learnt highlight that m-participation should be a part of a wider strategy that includes offline and other media channels, that it utilises mobile features such as location-based services and Social Media integration to enhance efficacy of participation, and to make the offer focused on the user experience rather than a singular topic.","tags":null,"title":"Assessing Mobile Participation: A case Study of iCitizen, Buycott and USHAHIDI","type":"publication"}]
