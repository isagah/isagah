      <description>The seminar was conducted at the University of Koblenz-Landau by Prof. Maria A. Wimmer for four months. It aimed to examine the significance of ICT tools supporting citizens participation and engagement in matters related to their communities. During the seminar, e-participation models were introduced. Also, we analyzed participation tools used in Germany as well as other countries to assess their usability. Also, the use of mobile technologies in promoting citizen participation was analyzed.</description>
