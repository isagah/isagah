Despite the demand, research on the design and implementation of m-government is still scarce. The current literature hardly provides comprehensive recommendations for implementing such services in developing countries. This paper aims to bridge the gap by examining the challenges of m-government services from the m-government practitioners of developing countries. Also, it explores the solutions applied by the practitioners to address the challenges. To achieve these goals, online questionnaire and interviews techniques were used to collect data. MAXQDA tool was used to analyze raw data, and we applied the PESTELMO method to categorize the challenges. Results show that designers are facing problems related to requirement engineering, stakeholder management, budget allocation and technology standards. We provide recommendations to improve m-government designs in the future to ensure accessibility and sustainability of services. The recommendations are applicable to government organizations and practitioners of mobile public services.","tags":null,"title":"Recommendations for M-Government Implementation in Developing Countries: Lessons Learned from the Practitioners ","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tupokigwe Isagah"],"categories":null,"content":"Today’s social media is populated with Artificial Intelligence (AI) debates as a promising technology to solve real-world challenges.
